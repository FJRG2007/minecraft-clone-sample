# Minecraft Clone Sample

This is a sample project to improve my GitHub profile.

Thanks to the use of technologies like ThreeJS you can create geniliadades like the one you are about to see.

This project will focus mainly on the code itself rather than the result.

These are the features that the project currently has.

### Features

* Block building system based on player positioning.
* Daily cycle (accelerated for sample).
